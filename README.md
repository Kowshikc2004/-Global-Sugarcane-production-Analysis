# **Sugarcane Production Analysis**

## **Overview**
This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) of sugarcane production across various countries and continents. It examines factors such as production volume, land allocation, yield efficiency, and correlations between different variables.

## **Project Structure**

### **1. Sugarcane EDA**
This notebook performs a detailed analysis at the country level, covering:
- **Univariate Analysis**  
  - Outlier detection  
  - Sugarcane production trends  
- **Bivariate Analysis**  
  - Correlation between land allocation and production  
  - Relationship between yield per hectare and total production  
- **Country-Specific Insights**  
  - Top 10 countries by land allocation  
  - Countries with the highest yield (kg/Hectare)  
  - Countries with the highest sugarcane production  

### **2. Analysis on Continent**
This notebook expands the analysis to the continent level, focusing on:
- **Continental Sugarcane Production Trends**
- **Impact of the Number of Countries on Total Production**
- **Production Distribution and Correlations**

## **Dataset**
The analysis uses a dataset on sugarcane production worldwide. The dataset includes:
- Country names
- Sugarcane production volume (in tons)
- Land allocated for sugarcane cultivation
- Yield per hectare

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Seaborn**
- **Matplotlib**

## **Getting Started**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
